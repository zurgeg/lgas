The LGAS is a small compute system that can be built cheaply. Here's an explaination:

^^^^^^^
The above is an LGAS, with a 4 by 4 instruction set, 8-bits.

We can use the LGAS for Logic, like so:


I - - O1
+ + + +
+ + + +
+ + + +

^^^^^^^
In the above diagram, the LGAS has an Input at (0, 0), Hence the "I" there. 
At the far right (3, 0) we have an output that is on, hence the O1 there.

To make logic, we can do something like:

I O1 - O0
- | - -
- | - -
- I - -
  
In this example, the I at the bottom cuts of the I in the northwest corner, so it winds up outputting at (1, 0)

Then more logic can be applied using logic gates and checking the state of certain pins.
